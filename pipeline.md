# slides extraction

* attr: class_code, topic, date?
* text extraction: 
    * probably sure there's py lib for pptx, etc we can just use
    * for imgs, just ignore for now
* chunking: one slide per chunk? since normally one topic per slide


# embedding  

* models: test small first, can store diff models embeddings
* embed each chunk?
* maybe generate a concepts list per chunk to cmp later

# db schema

* can we get away with using chromadb, or need postgres (i dont have exp)
*
